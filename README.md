Overview: The purpose of the analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, for a presentation to the CEO of the mock company Py-ber, create a line graph that shows total weekly fares for each city type. Lastly, perform a written report summarizing how the data differs by city types and how these differences can be used by Py-ber
Results:	 There are differences in the ride-sharing data among the different city types. This includes total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. Total drivers differed by Urban cities having the most drivers with 59602, Suburban cities having 8570 drivers and Rural cities having 537 drivers. This meant total fares in urban cities were highest and thus lowest in rural cities, but average fare per driver was about $8 in rural cities and about $0.66 in urban cites.
Total fare by city type was much higher in urban cities than in suburban and rural cities as can be seen in the chart below.

Summary: Based on the results discussed above, the CEO should move forward with a couple of actions. First action should be to take on more drivers in the rural cities, in rural cities it is obvious that each ride is charged more than it is in other delegated areas thus if there were more drivers in the rural areas then there would be more money to be made by the company. Second action should be to charge more per fare in the urban cities, they are only making 66 cents per driver in the urban cities thus more needs to be charged per driver. Last recommendation is to cut some drivers in the city areas, for like is staed before, 66 cents per driver is not very much. Cutting the amount of drivers would increase the fare per driver in urban cities significantly.
